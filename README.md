# 👋 Hi, I’m @pico-bolero
I'm a practicing software engineeer since 2000. Currently, I am a team lead and 
I've filled the role of architect and project manager for some smaller projects.

## 👀 I’m interested in ...
too many things. I like to [blog](https://pico-bolero.medium.com/) and write about the stuff I am doing and share it with friends. 
I really like software, if I wasn't doing it for a living, I probably would still be writing software.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
the Rust programming language and probably reading something in the pop-psy realm.

## Other info
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on articles, project ideas, and maybe interested a small joint project to test the waters for long term partnership.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to cycle, weight train, play board games, read books, and overeat.
